# These are generic settings, designed to be used on robots where
# site-specific global costmap settings have yet to be determined. These
# settings call for a blank, rolling-window costmap, centered on the robot.
# In the final global costmap configuration for a given site, we use a fixed
#  (non-rolling window) costmap that covers the whole station. The correct
# dimensions and offsets are then installed on the robots by our Ansible
# deployment scripts.
# See https://github.com/QuantumSpatialInc/robot-deployment/tree/master/templates/nav_config
